# After-Sales Assistant

LangGraph-powered after-sales agent with summary-based knowledge routing and on-demand retrieval. Supports order lookup, refund and exchange workflows with a built-in knowledge management panel. Deployed on EdgeOne Makers.

**Framework:** LangGraph · **Category:** Chat · **Language:** TypeScript

[![Deploy to EdgeOne Makers](https://cdnstatic.tencentcs.com/edgeone/pages/deploy.svg)](https://edgeone.ai/makers/new?template=after-sales-assistant&from=within&fromAgent=1&agentLang=typescript)

## Overview

This template implements a state-machine-driven customer service agent that recognizes user intent, routes to specialized handlers, and retrieves knowledge on demand. No vector database is required — FAQs and product knowledge are matched via summary-based routing and loaded only when needed.

- **Intent Recognition** — Classifies incoming messages into FAQ, order lookup, refund, exchange, or general chat.
- **Knowledge Routing** — Matches user queries to the most relevant knowledge base entry via summary similarity, then loads the full content on demand.
- **Order Workflows** — Dedicated handlers for order lookup, refund requests, and exchange requests with structured data validation.
- **Knowledge Management Panel** — A separate management endpoint for adding, updating, and organizing FAQ entries and product documents.
- **State Persistence** — Workflow state is persisted via `langgraphStore` so multi-turn interactions survive across requests.
- **Bilingual UI** — Full Chinese / English interface with locale-aware AI output.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Yes | Model gateway API key. Use your Makers Models API Key, or any OpenAI-compatible provider key. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` | Yes | Gateway base URL. For Makers Models, use `https://ai-gateway.edgeone.link/v1`. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL` | No | Model ID. Defaults to `@makers/deepseek-v4-flash`. |

This template follows the OpenAI-compatible standard — point these at Makers Models or any compatible provider.

### How to get AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY

1. Open the Makers Console (https://edgeone.ai/makers/new?s_url=https://console.tencentcloud.com/edgeone/makers)
2. Sign in and enable Makers
3. Go to Makers → Models → API Key and create a key
4. Copy it into `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`

> Built-in models are free within quota and great for validation. For production, bind your own paid provider key (BYOK).

## Local Development

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+
- EdgeOne CLI (`npm i -g edgeone`)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY and AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL
edgeone makers dev
```

Open the local observability dashboard at http://localhost:8088/agent-metrics.

Files prefixed with `_` are private modules — not exposed as public routes.

## How It Works

### Runtime Mode
Files under `agents/` run in **session mode**: requests with the same `conversation_id` are sticky-routed to the same agent instance. This ensures LangGraph state and conversation context persist across follow-up messages.

### End-to-End Workflow

1. **Message intake** — The frontend POSTs `/chat` with the user message and locale via the `makers-conversation-id` header.
2. **State load** — The handler loads any previously saved workflow state from `langgraphStore` for this conversation.
3. **Intent recognition** — The LangGraph `intent_recognition` node classifies the message into one of: `faq_search`, `lookup_order`, `request_refund`, `request_exchange`, or `general_chat`.
4. **Conditional routing** — The `routeByIntent` edge dispatches to the appropriate handler node based on the classified intent.
5. **Node execution**:
   - **faq_search** — Matches the query against knowledge base summaries, loads the best-matching full entry, and returns the answer.
   - **lookup_order** — Queries order data and returns status, items, and tracking info.
   - **request_refund** / **request_exchange** — Guides the user through the return/exchange flow with structured field collection.
   - **general_chat** — Handles open-ended questions with the LLM directly.
6. **State save** — The updated workflow state is persisted back to `langgraphStore`.
7. **SSE output** — The response streams back as SSE events including `text_delta`, `tool_called`, and UI card events for the frontend to render.

### Key Routes & Parameters
- `/chat` — Main customer service endpoint. Header: `makers-conversation-id: <uuid>`; Body: `{ message, locale? }`.
- `/manage` — Knowledge base management (add/update/delete FAQ entries). Body: `{ action, data }`.
- `/upload` — Document upload for knowledge base ingestion. Body: `{ files[] }`.
- `/seed-demo` — Initializes demo FAQ and order data for first-time setup.
- `/stop` — Aborts the active run. Body: `{ conversation_id }`.
- `/health` — Liveness probe (lives in `cloud-functions/`, not AI-related).
- `conversation_id` is generated client-side and forwarded via the `makers-conversation-id` header; the runtime auto-binds it to `context.conversation_id`.

### Timeouts
No custom agent timeout is configured; the platform default applies.
